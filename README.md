---

--> This project was the first project of the "Networking" course (Project #7 of the program).

--> The goal was to design and create the structure of a Book Listing app which would allow a user to get a list of published books on a given topic. It was required to use the google books api in order to fetch results and display them to the user.

--> Project specifications can be found [here](documentation/udacity-abn-book-finder-app-specifications.pdf).
